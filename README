= SQLite/Ruby Interface

This module allows Ruby programs to interface with the SQLite
database engine (http://www.sqlite.org).  You must have the
SQLite engine installed in order to build this module.

Note that this module is NOT compatible with SQLite 3.


== Compilation and Installation

Simply do the following, after installing SQLite:

  ruby install.rb

Alternatively, you can download and install the RubyGem package for
SQLite/Ruby (you must have RubyGems and SQLite installed, first):

  gem install --remote sqlite-ruby


== Usage

For help figuring out the SQLite/Ruby interface, check out the
FAQ[http://sqlite-ruby.rubyforge.org/faq.html]. It includes examples of
usage. If you have any questions that you feel should be address in the
FAQ, please send them to jamis@jamisbuck.org.
